RESPOSIVE DIAGRAM APP

-i used (beautiful-react-diagrams) to build this app

- writed everything in the same file because it was shorter and easier and to not disturb the data

-the data dont refresh automaticly when removing the lag comes from the library itself ,, i tried the same logic on another lib and it works,,, but it updates the data on any change
